# Flight Finder

For this project we used a combination of different APIs for building a cheap flight finder. 
The program finds the best deals (cheapest flights) and return them to us based on the cities we are interested in.
The user is supposed to set a threshold for the maximum price they are willing to pay. The API will provide the user with prices below the threshold set. 
Once the lowest price is found, the user will receive an email and SMS with the flight information including price and a link to buy the ticket.
